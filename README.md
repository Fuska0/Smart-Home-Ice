# Smart-Home-Ice
The application is supposed to allow remote management of devices of the so-called "smart home", which is equipped with various devices, for example, chad detectors or remotely controlled refrigerators, stoves, surveillance cameras with PTZ option, bulbulators, etc. Each device can come in several slightly different varieties, and each of them in a certain (small) number of instances. The house does not currently offer the ability to build complex systems, only allowing users to control individual devices and read their status.

### Additional information and requirements:

- Each smart home device is represented by a server-side object/service. How it integrates and communicates with the actual device is not the focus of the project. Devices can run on multiple server instances (demonstration: on at least two).
- When designing the device interface, you should also use types more complex than string or int/long. You need to remember to declare and report exceptions (or errors) where this may be applicable.
- It is sufficient to support two-three device types, one-two of which may have two-three subtypes. 
- It is necessary to map the given requirements to the features of the chosen technology in such a way as to make the best use of the possibilities offered by it for building such an application and to achieve the most elegant solution (if the desired functionality could not be directly achieved). Design decisions must be able to justify.
- The set of devices may be immutable during the life of the server (i.e., adding a new device may require modifying the server code and restarting the process). The client application may be aware of the supported device types at compile time.
- The initial state of the supported device instance can be included in the server-side source code or configuration file.
- The client application should allow to demonstrate control of different devices without rebooting to switch to another device.
- The server can provide functionality to list the names (IDs) of currently available device instances.

Middleware technology: any. Realizing communication in ICE, implement individual smart home devices as separate middleware objects, which can be accessed by providing its Identity ("Joe"). When implementing communication in Thrift or gRPC, you should aim to minimize the number of instances of exposed services (but without extremism - a refrigerator and a bulbulator cannot be described by a common interface!). 
Programming languages: two different (one for the client, the other for the server)
